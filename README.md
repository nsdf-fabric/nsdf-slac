## Overview

The **NSDF Dark Matter Initiative** delivers state-of-the-art tools for accessing and analyzing dark matter data, including a web-based event visualization [dashboard](./dashboard), a [command-line interface](./nsdf_dark_matter_cli) (CLI) for data access,
and a [library](./nsdf_dark_matter) for data manipulation. By combining ease of access with scientific depth, the initiative empowers the community to accelerate discovery in dark matter research.

## ‚ö°Quick Start

To get up and running quickly, follow the step-by-step guides found in the [NSDF Dark Matter documentation](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nsdf-slac/)

## üöÄ Features

- **Web-based visualization:** Explore midas files, isolate detector channels, and examine detailed metadata such as trigger types and timestamps, all within the browser with the [NSDF Dark Matter Dashboard](https://services.nationalsciencedatafabric.org/darkmatter).
- **Easy data access via CLI**: Effortlessly search, and download dark matter data files using the [NSDF Dark Matter CLI](./docs/cli.md).
- **Workflow integration**: Leverage [NSDF Dark Matter Library](./docs/library.md) to load and manipulate dark matter data, enabling seamless integration into workflow pipelines, including machine learning.
- **Search events**: Search for specific events using the autocomplete input.
- **Visualization**: Visualize channel waveforms from multiple detectors.
- **Channel isolation**: Select or deselect channels from one or more detectors.
- **Event metadata**: View information about the trigger type, readout type, and timestamp of the events.

## ‚öôÔ∏èWorkflow Suite

### üìä NSDF Dark Matter Dashboard

The [NSDF Dark Matter Dashboard](https://services.nationalsciencedatafabric.org/darkmatter) provides a web-based interface to visualize and explore dark matter data all within the browser. Learn about the controls that make the dashboard from [dashboard guide](./docs/dashboard.md).

### üñ•Ô∏è NSDF Dark Matter CLI

The [NSDF Dark Matter CLI](./nsdf_dark_matter_cli) offers a pool of operations to access the R76 dark matter dataset. The CLI can be used as part of a workflow to download data which can
then be analyzed with the [NSDF Dark Matter Library](https://github.com/nsdf-fabric/nsdf-slac/tree/main/nsdf_dark_matter). Learn about the CLI from [CLI guide](./docs/cli.md).

### üìö NSDF Dark Matter Library

The [NSDF Dark Matter Library](./nsdf_dark_matter) offers a pool of operations to manipulate dark matter data from getting event metadata to detector channel data acquisition. Learn about the library usage in [library guide](./docs/library.md).
